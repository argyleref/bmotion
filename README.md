Thanks for trying out bMotion!

You can also get limited assistance from #bmotion on EFNet -- note
I do this in my spare time so if I'm not around to help, don't take
it personally :) Perhaps a community of other people who can help
will spring up.

The official home for documentation is now 
https://github.com/jamesoff/bmotion/wiki

Have fun!
